## 1. Introduction to UML Class Diagrams

### 1.1 What is a UML Class Diagram?
A **UML Class Diagram** is a key tool in software engineering that helps visualize and document the structure of a system. It shows the classes, their attributes and methods, and how these classes interact with each other.

Specifically a class diagram describes the structure of a system by showing its:
- Classes
- their attributes
- Operations (Methods)
- and the relationships among objects

#### What is a Class?

A class is a ==blueprint== for an object.
It describes ==**what an object will be**==, but it isn't the object itself.

==Classes describe the type of Object.==  - *Blueprint*

==Objects are useable instances of classes.== - *Building*

## 2. Basic Building Blocks of a Class Diagram

### 2.1 Classes
A **class** is the fundamental building block, representing a blueprint for objects. It is typically drawn as a rectangle split into compartments for the class name, attributes, and methods.

#### 2.1.1 Class Name
This is the identifier for the class (e.g., `Person`, `Car`, `Account`).

#### 2.1.2 Class Structure (Three Compartments)
1. **Name** (top)  
2. **Attributes** (middle)  
3. **Operations (Methods)** (bottom)

### 2.2 Attributes (Properties, Fields)
Attributes represent the data or state of a class (e.g., `name`, `age`, `balance`). They are often listed with a notation for visibility and type.

#### 2.2.1 Access Modifiers (Public-Private-Protected)
- `+` **public** - Visible to all classes and objects.
- `-` **private**  - Visible only within the same class.
- `#` **protected**  - Visible to the class itself and its subclasses.

### 2.3 Operations (Methods)
Operations define the behaviours of a class (e.g., `talk()`, `walk()`, `deposit(amount)`, `withdraw(amount)`).

#### 2.3.1 Method Parameters and Return Types
Operations can accept parameters (with types) and have a return type (e.g., `: void`, `: int`).

#### 2.3.2 Access Modifiers in Methods
Just like attributes, methods can be `public (+)`, `private (-)`, or `protected (#)`.
